						<h2>Tillandsias</h2>
						<p>Tillandsias are attractive and fascinating members of the pineapple family (Bromeliad). They are commonly known as Air Plants. Tillandsias are native to Latin America where they can be found growing on rocks and trees without soil. They receive all of thieir water and nutrients through scales on their leaves. Their wire like roots are used for anchoring only. All Tillandsias bloom, and then produce off-shoots from the base of the plant called pups. These pups can be divided or left to form a clump.</p>

						<h3>Plant Care</h3>
						
						<p><strong>Water</strong>: Tillandsias need watered about once a week. Simply remove your plant from its display and submerge it in water. Soak the entire plant (all the leaves need a drink) for 10-15 minutes. Gently shake off excess water and allow plant to dry again.</p>
						<img src="img/assets/tsiliandas_2.jpg" alt="Products Tsiliandas">
						<p>I state "about once a week" because it is not an exact science. If your home is particularly dry (with a fire place maybe), water your plant more often. If your home is particularly moist (lots of air conditioning for example), water less often. The type of plant makes a difference too. Plants with more scales or "fuzz" hold more water, therefore, need water less often. Plants that are stiff or have very thin leaves hold less water, therefore, need watered more often.</p>
						<img src="img/assets/tsiliandas_3.jpg" alt="Products Tsiliandas">
						<p><strong>Light</strong>: Don't forget light! Tillandsias need filtered sun. They will respond to fluorescent lighting also. Just make sure that they are getting some form of day and night regularly. Don't hesitate to move the plant around to different places to see where it grows best.</p>
						<img src="img/assets/tsiliandas_4.jpg" alt="Products Tsiliandas">
						<p><strong>Temperature</strong>: Tillandsias are tropical plants so they can withstand high temperatures, but do not let them go below 50*F.</p>
